# SYLLABUS

## OVERVIEW

This course is an introduction to progamming with the [arduino](http://arduino.cc) microcontroller. It will cover the basics of electricy and programming through exploring different components: AC motor, stepper motor, force sensing resistor, flex sensor, LED, RGB LED, light sensor, distance sensor, potentiometer, accelerometer). We will be using the textbook Arduino Projects Book by the Arduino team. This course works directly in conjunction with CB Goodman's set design course in which together the outcome will be to create a 1/4 inch model that replicates a large scale gallery installation exploring climate change.

	* [What is Arduino?](http://arduino.cc)

	
* Microcontrollers
	* timers, thermostats, toys, remote controls, microwave ovens.
	* Do one specific task and have been programmed to sense and control activity using sensors and actuators.
	* Sensors
		* Listen to the physical world. They convert energy that you give when you press buttons, or wave your arms, or shout, into electrical signals. Buttons and knobs are sensors that you touch with your fingers, but there are many other kinds of sensors.
	* Actuators
		* Take action in the physical world. They convert electrical energy back into physical energy, like light and heat and movement.
	* Microcontrollers listen to sensors and talk to actuators. They decide what to do based on a program that you write.
	* Microcontrollers and the electronics you attach to them are just the skeleton of your projects, though. Youâ€™ll need to bring skills you probably already have to put some  flesh on the bones.
		
* **IN-CLASS**: Create a list of instructions for each other to do in class. Try to be very specific.

### CLASS 2: Set-up and Commands part 1 (Functions)

* Code is like using magic in Harry Potter. You have to get the spelling of the words exactly correct. Though you can make your own magic words too!
* [Arduino Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage)
* Be comfortable not knowing everything all at once.
* setup() runs once in the beggining.
* loop() when setup is finished it runs over and over again.
* pinMode()
* digitalWrite()
* delay()
* map()
* Serial.begin()
* Serial.println()

### CLASS 3: Electricity


### CLASS 4: Commands part 2 (Functions), conditionals, and other syntax

* if
* if...else
* for

* ; (semicolon)
* {} (curly braces)
* Code Blocks { }
* // (single line comment)

* == (equal to)
* != (not equal to)
* < (less than)
* > (greater than)
* <= (less than or equal to)
* >= (greater than or equal to)


* && (and)
* || (or)
* ! (not)


* [Variables](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/tree/master/chp04_variables)
	* Declare
	* Initialize
	* Use
	* 'Built-in' variables
	* Types
		* `Boolean`
		* `String`
		* `Number`

* Variation
	* [`random()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random)
	* `x = x + 1` shorthand: `x+=1` or even `x++`
	* [`map()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/map)

* Debugging
	* [Chrome Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console) (OPTION COMMAND J)
	* `console.log()`

	
* [Conditionals](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing-p5.js/tree/master/chp05_conditionals)
	* Boolean expressions
		* I am hungry (true)
		* I am afraid of computer programming (false)
		* I am funny (false)
		* 15 is greater than 20 (false)
		* 5 equals 5 (true)
		* 32 is less than or equal to 33 (true)
	* Using a variable to take different paths in our program depending on the current value stored in the variable
		* x > 20 (depends on value of x)
		* y == 5 (depends on value of y)
		* z <= 33 (depends on value of z)
	* Operators
		* `< > >= <= == !=`
	* `If, else if, else`
		* Operate as questions
			* Allows us to execute certain instructions based on if the answer is `true` or `false`
			* If I am hungry then eat some food, otherwise if I am thirsty drink some water, otherwise take a nap
			* Pseudo Code
				* If the mouse is on the left side of the screen, draw a rectangle on the left side of the screen
					* `if (mouseX < width/2){
						fill(255);
						rect(0,0,width/2,height);
					}`
			* Can also be expanded by `else`
				* `if (mouseX < width/2){
					background(255);
				} else {
					background(0);
				}`
			* Can be further expanded by `else if`
				* `if (mouseX < width/3){
					background(255);
				} else if (mouseX < 2 * width/3){
					background(127);
				} else {
					background(0);
				}`
			* Grading system excercise
				* `var grade = random(0,100);
					if (___) {
						console.log('Assign letter grade A');
					} else if (___) {
						console.log('___');
					} else if (___) {
						console.log('___');
					} else if (___) {
						console.log('___');
					} else {
						console.log('___');
					}`
	* Logical Operators
		* `&& ||`
		* If my temperature is greater than 98.6 OR I have a rash on my arm, take me to see a doctor
		* If I am stung by a bee AND I am allergic to bees, take me to see the doctor
		* If the mouse is on the right side of the screen AND the mouse is on the bottom of the screen, draw a rectangle in the bottom right corner.
		* We could use a nested if statement, but it can be simpler with using the logical AND (`&&`)
		* If my temperature is NOT greater than 98.6, I won't call in sick to CoLab
		* If I am stung by a bee AND I am NOT allergic to bees, don't worry!
		* `if (mousePressed){
			ellipse(width/2, height/2, 100, 100);
		} else {
			rect(width/2, height/2, 100, 100);
		}`
	* `Boolean` variables
* **IN-CLASS**:
